**üéØ Session goal:** To provide a practical toolkit, a clear process, and a strategic mindset for creating effective and influential presentations.

**üïí Duration:** 2 hours (120 minutes), no break.

### **Why this session matters: From analysis to influence**

* **A talk is a gift:** Your goal is not a performance, but an act of generosity: rebuilding an idea that matters to you inside the minds of your listeners.
* **The goal is "truth-seeking," not selling:** As Jeff Bezos argues, the purpose of an internal meeting is a collaborative search for truth. Slides can obscure "sloppy thinking," while a written narrative forces clarity and intellectual honesty.
* **Presentation literacy is a learnable skill:** Powerful public speaking is not an innate talent but a core 21st-century skill that anyone can learn with the right tools and preparation.
* **Authenticity is your foundation:** The goal is not to imitate other speakers but to find the style that is most natural to you. Audiences trust and connect with a genuine speaker, not a performance.

### **Module 2: üß± The anatomy of a great slide (25 mins)**

* **Objective:** Understand the core principles of effective slide design.

* **The golden rule: one slide = one core idea.**
    * Your slides must serve and enhance your spoken words, never distract from them. The goal is a human connection.

* **Design philosophy for clarity:**
    * **Be visual, not verbose:** Images are more effective than words.
    * **Simplify to amplify:** As Leonardo da Vinci said, "Simplicity is the supreme sophistication." Think like a Zen master: to create is to remove.
    * **Maximize the signal-to-noise ratio:** Make your charts and tables more graphic, readable, and focused on the essential information.
    * **Use "build-ups":** Present complex diagrams, charts, or even text progressively to guide the audience's focus.

* **The rule of three:**
    * Cognitive science shows our brains process information in threes.
    * Limit yourself to 3 key messages per presentation, 3 supporting points per message, and a maximum of 3 bullet points per slide.

### **Module 3: üìú The art of storytelling and audience adaptation (30 mins)**

* **Objective:** Structure your content into a persuasive narrative and adapt it for any audience.

* **Find your throughline:** The throughline is the single most critical tool. It's the connecting theme that ties every element of your talk together.
    * **Topic vs. throughline:** A topic is broad ("Machine Learning Models"). A throughline is a specific, intriguing point about that topic ("More choice in ML models actually makes us less effective").
    * **The 15-word rule:** A strong throughline should be summarizable in 15 words or less to force absolute clarity.

* **The core of drama: Protagonist-objective-obstacle**
    * The engine of a story is conflict, based on a simple trio:
        * **Protagonist:** A character (who?)
        * **Objective:** With a concrete goal (what?) and a stake in it (why?)
        * **Obstacle:** Who encounters obstacles that generate conflict and emotion.

* **The hero's journey: A new perspective:**
    * This is a classic structure based on a quest for change.
    * **A powerful mindset shift:** **The audience is your hero**. **You are the mentor**. Your job is to invite them on a quest, help them overcome obstacles, and call them to action.

* **Cultural context: French vs. Anglo-Saxon styles**
    * **Narrative structure (persuading):**
        * **Anglo-Saxon (applications-first):** Begins with the conclusion or recommendation‚Äîthe "how."
        * **French (principles-first):** Begins by establishing a general principle, theory, or methodology‚Äîthe "why."
    * **Communication style (communicating):**
        * **Anglo-Saxon (low-context):** Communication must be precise, simple, explicit, and clear.
        * **French (high-context):** Communication is more nuanced, sophisticated, and layered.
    * **Q&A and debate (disagreeing):**
        * **Anglo-Saxon (avoids confrontation):** A Q&A is for clarification and alignment.
        * **French (confrontational):** Debate is a positive sign of engagement and respect.

### **Module 4: ‚úçÔ∏è The process: From chaos to clarity (25 mins)**

* **Objective:** Learn a structured, repeatable process for developing a presentation.

* **Golden rule #2: Do NOT start in PowerPoint!**
    * As Amazon's culture shows, slides with bullet points can hide "sloppy thinking".
    * A written narrative is a **"forcing function"** for clarity, compelling you to connect ideas, state assumptions, and build a coherent argument. The writing process reveals that our "thoughts" are often a jumble of half-baked impulses with gaping logical holes.

* **The 4-Step process:**
    1.  **Clarify (the narrative draft):** Write a half-page summary of your presentation in simple, literary language, as if explaining it to someone. Avoid bullet points.
    2.  **Simplify (the TOM framework):** From your summary, extract the three most critical elements:
        * **T (Theme):** What is the theme or subject of your presentation?
        * **O (Objective):** What is your primary, concrete objective? Frame it as "I want my audience to..." followed by an action verb.
        * **M (Message):** What is the single, memorable message you want to leave with your audience? For the 2007 iPhone launch, the message was: "Today, Apple reinvents the phone."
    3.  **Concentrate (the post-it):** Combine your T, O, and M into a single, powerful sentence. Write this on a post-it note; this is your destination. For the iPhone, it was: "Go buy the iPhone, the phone reinvented by Apple."
    4.  **Find your flow (oral by oral):** *Before* storyboarding, rehearse your presentation out loud, imagining your audience in front of you. Improvise from start to finish. This allows your thinking to take shape through the act of speaking. Record this improvisation to capture your natural narrative flow.

### **Module 5: ü§ñ Your AI co-pilot: Using LLMs (15 mins)**

* **Objective:** Integrate LLMs to improve presentation quality and speed.

* **Key Use Cases:**
    * Create a plan: Generate a slide-by-slide outline from a prompt.
    * Draft content: Write bullet points or speaker notes for a slide.
    * Simplify language: Rewrite technical jargon for a business audience.
    * Find analogies: Brainstorm simple comparisons for complex ideas.
    * Get feedback: Ask an LLM to act as a stakeholder and critique your script.

### **Module 6: üé¨ Your task, delivery and wrap-up (10 mins)**

* **Objective:** Apply the concepts from this session and learn key delivery principles.

* **The Assignment:**
    1.  **Choose a project** you are currently working on or a technical concept you know well.
    2.  **Define its TOM** and concentrate it into a single sentence.
    3.  Use the 4-step process to create a **3-5 slide storyboard or a draft transcript.**
    4.  **Get AI Feedback:** Use the **[Presentation Clarity Coach](https://gemini.google.com/gem/1_q1o7mpix3EPjonn1TRoSQExFDcPKzMh?usp=sharing)** to get structured feedback on your draft. Paste your content and ask for a point-by-point review based on the principles from this workshop.
    5.  **Act on the feedback:** Be prepared to share one piece of feedback you received and how you used it to improve your presentation.
    6.  **Focus on practicing the *process*, not on creating perfect slides.**

* **Tips for delivery day:**
    * **Go solo for openings and closings:** Do not use visual aids for your introduction and conclusion. Be alone with your audience during these critical moments.
    * **Own the stage:** Stand in the center and place your visuals to the side. An actor performs on stage, with the set in the periphery.
    * **Slides are for the audience, not you:** A slide is a demonstration tool for the audience, not a memory aid for the speaker.
    * **Avoid unnecessary accessories:** Limit notes, pointers, and complex animations.
