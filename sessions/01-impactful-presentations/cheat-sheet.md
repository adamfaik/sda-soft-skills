# 🚀 Impactful presentations cheat sheet

This guide summarizes the key steps and principles from Session 1 to help you create clear, compelling, and influential presentations.

### **🧠 1. Mindset: Why are you presenting?**

* **It's a gift:** Your goal is to generously share a valuable idea, not just perform.
* **Seek truth, don't just sell:** Focus on clear thinking and honest communication, not just persuasion. Use the narrative process to expose weak points in your *own* thinking first.
* **Be authentic:** Speak in your natural style. Trust comes from genuineness.

### **✍️ 2. The process: Think first, design later**

* **🚫 Golden rule: do NOT start in PowerPoint!** Slides hide sloppy thinking. Writing forces clarity.
* **The 4-step process:**
    1.  **Clarify (narrative draft):** Write a half-page summary of your core message in simple prose. *This is the hard, essential work.*
    2.  **Simplify (TOM framework):** Extract the core:
        * **T (Theme):** What's the subject?
        * **O (Objective):** What do you want the audience to *do*? (Use an action verb).
        * **M (Message):** What's the single takeaway?
    3.  **Concentrate (post-it):** Combine T+O+M into one powerful sentence. This is your destination.
    4.  **Find flow (oral rehearsal):** *Before* slides, improvise your talk out loud. Record it to find your natural narrative.

### **📜 3. Storytelling: Structure your narrative**

* **Find your throughline:** Identify the single connecting theme. Can you state it in **15 words or less**? This is your filter for *all* content.
* **Core drama:** Remember Protagonist → Objective → Obstacle. Conflict makes stories engaging.
* **Hero's journey mindset:** **Your audience is the hero.** You are the mentor guiding them on a quest (your project/idea) to overcome obstacles.
* **Adapt to culture:**
    * **Anglo-Saxon:** Start with the conclusion ("Applications-first," Low-context). Q&A is for clarification.
    * **French:** Start with the principles/theory ("Principles-first," High-context). Q&A is for debate (a sign of respect).

### **🧱 4. Slide design: Enhance, don't distract**

* **Golden rule: one slide = one core idea.**
* **Simplify to amplify:** Less is more. Use visuals, not just words. Remove clutter (signal > noise). Design in B&W first.
* **Rule of three:** Max 3 messages, 3 supporting points, 3 bullets per slide.
* **Use build-ups:** Reveal complex info step-by-step.
* **Slides support you:** They are for the audience, not your teleprompter.

### **🤖 5. Leverage your AI co-pilot (LLMs)**

* **Use for:** Planning, drafting content, simplifying language, finding analogies.
* **CRITICAL STEP: Get feedback:**
    1.  Use the **[Presentation Clarity Coach](https://gemini.google.com/gem/1_q1o7mpix3EPjonn1TRoSQExFDcPKzMh?usp=sharing)**.
    2.  Paste your draft transcript or storyboard.
    3.  Ask for specific feedback based on the workshop principles.
    4.  **Act on the feedback:** This loop is essential for improvement.

### **🎬 6. Delivery day tips**

* **Go solo:** No slides for your intro and conclusion. Connect directly with the audience.
* **Own the stage:** Stand center; put visuals to the side.
* **Avoid accessories:** Keep it simple, no unnecessary pointers or excessive notes.
