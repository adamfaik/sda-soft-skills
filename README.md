# üöÄ From good to great: essential skills for the modern data scientist

Welcome! This repository contains the course materials for a series of workshops designed to complement your technical journey in the **[Dipl√¥me Sorbonne Data Science](https://formations.pantheonsorbonne.fr/fr/catalogue-des-formations/diplome-d-universite-DU/diplome-d-universite-KBVXM363/diplome-d-universite-sorbonne-data-analytics-KPMK3V7Z.html)**.

While your core curriculum provides a formidable foundation in technical areas like Python, SQL, Statistics, Machine Learning, MLOps, and Cloud technologies, these sessions focus on the transversal skills that elevate a good data scientist to a great one.

My goal is to equip you with a strategic mindset, enabling you to move beyond purely technical execution to solve business problems, drive strategy, and maximize your impact within any organization.

## üèõÔ∏è The core philosophy: Beyond the model

A great data scientist doesn't just build models; they create value. They understand that technical excellence is the prerequisite, but true influence comes from deeply understanding business needs, communicating insights effectively, and ensuring their work leads to tangible outcomes.

This training is built on three core pillars designed to bridge the gap between technical execution and strategic impact.

### üì¢ Pillar 1: Strategic communication and influence

Your analysis is only as valuable as your ability to communicate it. We will move beyond basic reporting to master the art of storytelling with data. The initial module on **creating impactful presentations** is just the entry point into a broader skill set.

In these sessions, you will learn to:
* Translate complex technical findings from your machine learning models into clear, actionable insights for non-technical stakeholders.
* Structure compelling narratives that influence key business decisions.
* Develop a deep understanding of your audience to tailor your message for maximum resonance and impact.

### üó∫Ô∏è Pillar 2: Product and project management for data science

The most effective data scientists treat their projects as products. This means starting with the user and the business need, not just the dataset. This module will introduce you to a product-centric and structured approach for your work.

We will cover key concepts including:
* **Business and strategy:** How to dissect a business problem and align your data science initiatives with overarching company goals.
* **User-centricity:** The fundamentals of user research and how to build empathy to ensure you are solving a real-world problem.
* **Agile for data science and project execution:** Learn to structure your projects using frameworks like CRISP-DM and adapt agile methodologies for the experimental nature of data science to ensure timely and valuable delivery.

### üå± Pillar 3: Collaborative excellence and career growth

Your long-term success is linked to your ability to collaborate effectively and navigate your career path. This pillar focuses on mastering stakeholder interactions and strategically positioning yourself for growth.

This section will explore:
* **Data science consulting and stakeholder management:** Go beyond just being a technical expert to become a strategic partner. Learn to frame ambiguous requests, manage stakeholder expectations, and guide the conversation to drive impactful outcomes.
* **Enhanced productivity and career navigation with LLMs:**
    * Leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to augment your daily workflow‚Äîfrom accelerating coding to drafting communications.
    * Apply these tools to your career development by learning how to build a compelling professional brand, create a standout portfolio that showcases business impact, and prepare for the modern data science interview.

This repository will be your central resource for all slides, notes, and supplementary materials for these sessions.
