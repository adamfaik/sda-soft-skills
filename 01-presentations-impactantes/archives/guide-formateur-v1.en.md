# Trainer's guide session 1

**Session goal:** Equip data scientists with a practical toolkit, process, and mindset for creating effective presentations by demonstrating the principles live.

**Unique format:** This session intentionally **does not use pre-made slides**. The core of the workshop involves the trainer *building* example slides and exploring resources live, demonstrating the application of the principles in real-time.

### **Setup and preparation**

1.  **Screen setup:**
    * **Split your screen** into two halves.
    * **Right side:** Have the student-facing `README.md` file for this session open. This is your primary guide and reference point. You will navigate this file throughout the session.
    * **Left Side:** Have a web browser open. You will use this for:
        * Opening and demonstrating tools (Gamma, Flaticon, Google Fonts, etc.).
        * Opening a blank presentation tool (e.g., Google Slides) to create slides live.
        * Showing examples (if you have quick links ready).
        * Using an LLM live.

2.  **Resources ready:**
    * Ensure all links in the `README.md` are working.
    * Have a blank Google Slides (or PowerPoint) presentation ready to open.
    * Have the link to the "Presentation Clarity Coach" AI assistant ready to share.

3.  **ðŸ”´ IMPORTANT: Start recording!** Before you begin the session, ensure you have started recording. Announce that the session is being recorded for later reference.

### **Trainer principles and behavior**

* **Be the guide, not the sage:** Use the `README.md` openly as your map. Scroll through it, refer to sections. It shows the students the structure you're following.
* **Embrace live creation:** The power of this session is *showing* the process. Open Google Slides and *build* simple slides during Module 2 and potentially Module 3. Show how you apply principles like "One Idea Per Slide" or "Simplify to Amplify."
* **Show, don't just tell:** Click the links in the `README.md`. Briefly demonstrate Gamma's interface, how to find an icon on Flaticon, how to pick colors on Coolors.
* **Interactive and engaging:** Constantly ask questions. "What makes this slide bad?" "What's a good Throughline for this example?" "Has anyone used this tool?" Use names if possible. Keep the energy up.
* **Think aloud:** Verbalize your design choices as you build slides live. "Okay, this title is too vague, let's make it an action sentence..." "This slide feels cluttered, I need to remove something..."
* **Model imperfection:** Live creation won't be perfect. That's okay! It makes the process less intimidating. Focus on demonstrating the *principles* and the *process*, not on creating flawless final slides on the fly.
* **Manage time:** Keep an eye on the clock. Stick roughly to the module timings outlined in the `README.md`. Gently move the discussion along if needed.

### **Session flow (120 minutes)**

1.  **Launch recording (0 min)**
    * *Self-reminder: Did you press record?*

2.  **Welcome and introduction (0-5 min)**
    * Welcome participants.
    * Briefly introduce yourself and your background/credibility related to presentations.
    * State the session goal (from the `README.md`).

3.  **The hook: Introduce the AI assistant (5-10 min)**
    * "Before we dive into the fundamentals, I want to show you a powerful tool you'll use at the end and beyond."
    * Introduce the **Presentation Clarity Coach**. Explain its purpose: To give structured feedback based *specifically* on the principles we'll learn today.
    * Share the link in the chat: `https://gemini.google.com/gem/1_q1o7mpix3EPjonn1TRoSQExFDcPKzMh?usp=sharing`
    * Briefly demonstrate *asking* it for feedback (you can use a pre-written short text). Show the *kind* of output it gives (Observation, Principle, Suggestion).
    * **Crucially:** "We'll come back to *how* to best use AI like this for presentations later in Module 5. But I want you to have this link ready. It's your personal coach after this session."
    * Make sure everyone can access the link. Troubleshoot briefly if needed.

4.  **Transition to basics (10 min)**
    * "Okay, now that you have a tool to help you refine your work, let's build the foundation. How do we get to the point where we even *have* something to get feedback on? It starts with the right tools and mindset."
    * Briefly cover the "Why This Session Matters" points from the `README.md`.

5.  **Module 1: Toolkit (10-25 min)**
    * Navigate to Module 1 in the `README.md` (right screen).
    * Go through each tool category.
    * *Live Demo (Right Screen):* Briefly open 2-3 key links. Show Gamma's landing page, search for an icon on Flaticon, browse Google Fonts, show a color palette on Coolors, open Excalidraw. *Don't spend too long on each.* Just show what they are.

6.  **Module 2: Slide anatomy (25-50 min)**
    * Navigate to Module 2 in the `README.md`. Cover the Golden Rule and Design Philosophy points.
    * *Live Demo (Right Screen):*
        * Open your blank Google Slides presentation.
        * Create a "Bad Slide": Vague title ("Results"), 7 bullet points with jargon, maybe a poorly chosen chart image pasted in.
        * Ask the audience: "What's wrong with this slide, based on what we just discussed?"
        * *Live*, transform it into a "Good Slide": Change the title to a key takeaway sentence. Reduce bullets to 3 key themes (or use icons). Replace the chart with a cleaner placeholder or sketch. Emphasize white space. Verbalize your changes. ("Okay, Rule of Three means I need to group these...")

7.  **Module 3: Storytelling and adaptation (50-80 min)**
    * Navigate to Module 3 in the `README.md`. Explain Throughline, Hero's Journey (Audience is Hero!), and Cultural Context.
    * *Live Discussion/Sketching (Right Screen or Whiteboard Tool):*
        * Take a simple data science project example (e.g., "Building a model to predict customer churn").
        * Ask the audience: "What's a possible 15-word Throughline for presenting this?"
        * Briefly sketch the Hero's Journey steps for this project on Miro/Excalidraw or even just verbally map it.
        * Ask: "How would you *start* this presentation differently for a French executive vs. an American one?" Highlight Principles-first vs. Applications-first.

8.  **Module 4: The process (80-105 min)**
    * Navigate to Module 4 in the `README.md`. Emphasize **"Do NOT Start in PowerPoint!"** Explain the value of the Narrative Draft.
    * Explain the 4 steps, focusing on the **TOM framework**. Use the iPhone example.
    * *Quick Activity:* "Take 60 seconds. Jot down a draft TOM for your current project. What's the Theme, Objective, Message?" (Optional: Ask 1-2 people to share).
    * Briefly mention the "Oral by Oral" rehearsal technique.

9.  **Module 5: AI co-pilot (105-115 min)**
    * Navigate to Module 5 in the `README.md`.
    * "Remember the AI Coach from the beginning? Let's look at how else LLMs can help."
    * *Live Demo (Right Screen):* Use Gemini (or another LLM).
        * Show a prompt: `"Generate a 3-slide plan for presenting a customer churn model to marketing."` Show the result.
        * Show another prompt: `"Simplify this technical sentence for a business audience: [paste jargon sentence]."` Show the result.
        * Reinforce using the AI Coach for feedback on their assignment drafts.

10. **Module 6: Task, delivery and wrap-up (115-120 min)**
    * Navigate to Module 6 in the `README.md`.
    * Clearly explain the assignment, emphasizing using the AI coach for feedback.
    * Quickly cover the key "Tips for Delivery Day."

11. **Module 7: Resources (mention briefly)**
    * Navigate to Module 7. "All the resources mentioned and more are listed here for your reference."

12. **Final Q&A and close (part of Module 6 time)**
    * Open floor for final questions.
    * Thank participants for their engagement. Reiterate the core message: Clear thinking and audience focus lead to impactful presentations.
